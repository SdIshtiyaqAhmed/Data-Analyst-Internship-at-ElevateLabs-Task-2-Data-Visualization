# Data Analyst Internship at ElevateLabs - Task 2: Data Visualisation

Refer to this repository for the data cleaning process using the pandas module in Python:   
Repository: [Data-Analyst-Internship-at-ElevateLabs-Task-1](https://github.com/SdIshtiyaqAhmed/Data-Analyst-Internship-at-ElevateLabs-Task-1). 

After the data cleaning is performed on the dataset *sales_data.csv* downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imranlukman/amazon-online-sales-dataset), we exported the dataset as *cleaned_sales_data.csv*. We can use the *cleaned_sales_data.csv* for data visualisation using Power BI as follows:

1. Import the *cleaned_sales_data.csv* file into Power BI.
2. Select various combinations of columns and charts.
3. Create the required data visualisations.
4. Arrange the charts on the dashboard page.
5. Export the file as a PDF or save the file.

The PDF in this repository is named *Data_Visualization_using_Power_BI.pdf* and consists of 3 pages:
